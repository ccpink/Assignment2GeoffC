During this assingment I used XAML and Command binding to create a ui program that knew when certain sections of code could be ran and when it couldn't be, I originally made it based in a format that used system files and changed that into an SQLite Database instead. Because of how I had originally set up the application the switch to an Database instead of files was easily done. I used class files to store the information in the application.
